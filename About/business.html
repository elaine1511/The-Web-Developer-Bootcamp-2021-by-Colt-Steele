<h1>Elaine Sandwich Restaurant</h1>
<p>
    My husband used to own a small company in Vietnam. His company sold lazy or bean bag chairs. He are really good at
    doing his own business. We would like to open a small Vietnamese sandwich restaurant. I used to work part time at
    one of Vietnamese fastfood restaurant. The concept of this restaurant is developing. I even can do the franchise
    with them if I can not start my own one.

<p>
    In fast growing city like Houston, <a href="https://www.myroostar.com/about">Roostar Vietnamese Grill</a> is one of
    the Vietnamese sucessfully mom and pop restaurant. They now have 2 branches and 1 coming soon.
    Their mission is to transport you to another place using fresh food & flavors and to make you feel at home with good
    olâ€™ fashioned Southern hospitality
